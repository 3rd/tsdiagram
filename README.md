# TSDiagram

**TSDiagram** is an online tool that helps you draft diagrams quickly by using TypeScript.

:point_right: https://tsdiagram.com

### **Features**

- Lets you define your data models through **top-level type aliases** and **interfaces**.
- Automatically layouts the nodes in an efficient way.
- ...but if you move one of the nodes manually, it will only auto-layout the other ones.
- Persists the document state in the URL and localStorage.
- Exports your diagrams as PNG.

### **Roadmap**

- Function call representation
- Export as SVG
- Customizable TypeScript context (lib, etc.)
- Bring your own storage (different vendors)

> This project is not just a diagramming tool, but also the foundation for a greater code visualization project.
> Imagine flagging types and functions in your code editor and see how they are connected, and how data flows through them.
> That's the end goal, so we'll swap the TS compiler with Tree-sitter in the process.
